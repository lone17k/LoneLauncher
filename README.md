# 🎶 Lone Launcher

A **minimalist Android launcher** inspired by the iconic **Zune interface**,  
reimagined with modern **Jetpack Compose**, smooth animations, and extra features.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is **not affiliated with Microsoft**.  
The word *Zune* is used only to describe the design inspiration.

## 🖼️ Goal & Vision

Zune was more than a music player — it was a **design statement**.  
This launcher pays homage to that design language:  

- **Typography-first UI** (focus on text, not icons)  
- **Minimal animations** (fade-in/out, retro glow)  
- **Functional extensions** → weather, quotes, battery, favorites  

The idea is to **make the home screen feel like an art piece**, but still functional.
