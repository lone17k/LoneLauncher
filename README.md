# 🎶 Lone Launcher

A **minimalist Android launcher** inspired by the iconic **Zune interface**,  
reimagined with modern **Jetpack Compose**, smooth animations, and extra features.  

The goal: capture the **retro Zune vibe** — clean typography, monochrome design, and focus on essentials —  
while adding practical tools for daily use.  

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎵 **Zune-inspired UI** → monochrome, retro style, bold typography
- ⏰ **Time & Date** → minimal, styled (large main time + smaller AM/PM)
- 🔋 **Animated Battery Bar** → retro-styled, glowing fill while charging
- 🌦 **Retro Weather Widget** → text-only icons (☀, 🌧, ❄) with live temperature
- 💡 **Daily Quotes** → API-based with a fallback collection of motivational minimal quotes
- ⭐ **Favorites List** → quick access to apps, styled with custom font
- 🔔 **Unread Notifications Count** (planned)
- 🖐 **Gesture Navigation** → swipe up (app search), swipe left/right (custom actions), long press (settings)
- 🎨 **Monochrome Theme** → Zune-like dark mode as default

## 🖼️ Goal & Vision

Zune was more than a music player — it was a **design statement**.  
This launcher pays homage to that design language:  

- **Typography-first UI** (focus on text, not icons)  
- **Minimal animations** (fade-in/out, retro glow)  
- **Functional extensions** → weather, quotes, battery, favorites  

The idea is to **make the home screen feel like an art piece**, but still functional.

## 📱 Screens & Components

- **Home Screen**
  - Time/Date in top left  
  - Battery bar under time  
  - Weather + quote at bottom  
  - Favorites on right edge  

- **App Search**
  - Type & find apps quickly  
  - Long press → favorite / uninstall / app info  

- **Settings**
  - Manage favorites  
  - Wallpaper picker  
  - Minimal toggles only

## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose**
- **Material 3**
